echo "my name is anurag";

# chmod is command that grants permissions to the file
# Format : chmod root:your group:all user
# To grant acces to everybody we can use : chmod 777 <filename>
# Linux basically uses a formula of :
# 4: read
# 2: write
# 1: execute
#
# so now we understand what 777 does ie it provides all the permissions (read, write, execure)
# and also we can see that 444 will only give read permissions.
#
# pipe commadn(|) : sends the output of the first command to the next command.
